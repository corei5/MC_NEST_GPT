MC_NEST is a **Monte Carlo Tree Search** framework enhanced with **GPT-4** designed to tackle complex mathematical problems. Inspired by the principles of Monte Carlo Tree Self-Refinement [1], MC_NEST represents a powerful fusion of AI-driven reasoning and algorithmic precision. The framework leverages the **GPT-4** API to refine, evaluate, and improve answers iteratively using **Nash Equilibrium-based exploration strategies** and **importance sampling techniques**.

## Features

- **GPT-4 Integration**: Harness the reasoning power of GPT-4 to solve and refine mathematical problems.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: An advanced implementation of MCTS with configurable selection policies and initialization strategies.
- **Multi-Agent Critique & Refinement**: GPT-based agents for answer refinement and critique through structured JSON responses.
- **Customizable Selection Policies**:
  - **GREEDY**
  - **IMPORTANCE SAMPLING**
  - **PAIRWISE IMPORTANCE SAMPLING**
- **Reward System**: Uses strict GPT-based evaluation with penalties for overestimation.
- **Visualization**: Built-in tree-printing utility to debug and analyze the MCTS process.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corei5/MC_NEST_GPT.git
cd MC_NEST_GPT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Import the Package

```bash
from MC_NEST_GPT.MC_NEST_GPT.MC_NEST_ import MC_NEST_gpt4o
import openai
```

## Set Up OpenAI API Key

Provide your OpenAI API key either directly or through environment variables:

```bash
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'
```

## Initialize and Run MC_NEST

Define your problem, configure MCTS settings, and execute:

```bash
problem = "Let $S$ be a list of positive integers not necessarily distinct in which the number $68$ appears. The average (arithmetic mean) of the numbers in $S$ is $56$. However, if $68$ is removed, the average of the remaining numbers drops to $55$. What is the largest number that can appear in $S$?"

MC_NEST = MC_NEST_gpt4o(
    problem=problem,
    max_rollouts=4,
    selection_policy=IMPORTANCE_SAMPLING,
    initialize_strategy=ZERO_SHOT
)

best_answer = MC_NEST.run()
print(best_answer)

```
## Customize Selection Policies

Choose from multiple selection policies:

```bash
GREEDY = 1
IMPORTANCE_SAMPLING = 2
PAIRWISE_IMPORTANCE_SAMPLING = 3

```
